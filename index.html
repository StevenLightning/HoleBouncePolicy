            Thank you for playing Hole Bounce! This game was built with the Unity game engine, and uses Unity Ads and Unity Analytics.
            This means that some data will be collected from users. Some of the data collected may include: unique device identifiers,
            IP address, device manufacturer, interactions with ads, and gameplay information. For a more detailed description of the
            data that may be collected through these services, you can view the official Unity privacy policy here:
